This program collects basic information about you, your name, hometown, and age—and displays it neatly. Here’s how it works:

Create a Storage Box: It starts by setting up a dictionary, which acts like a storage box for your information. This box has three sections: one for your name, one for your hometown, and one for your age.

Gather Your Name and Hometown: The program prompts you to enter your name and hometown. You type in your answers, and they get stored in the box for later use.

Ask About Your Age: Next, it wants to know your age. It uses a loop to keep asking until you provide a valid number. If you accidentally type something that isn’t a number (like "twenty"), it gently reminds you to enter a valid age.

Display Your Information: Finally, the program prints out everything you provided. You’ll see your name, hometown, and age displayed on the screen.
